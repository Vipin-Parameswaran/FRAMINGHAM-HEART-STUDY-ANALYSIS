## Framingham Heart Study
The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. It was initiated in 1948 and has since provided extensive data that has greatly contributed to our understanding of cardiovascular disease.

Key Points of the Framingham Heart Study     

Objective:                          
The primary goal was to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) by following its development over a long period in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.

Participants:                                    
The original cohort included 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham.
Additional cohorts have been added over the years, including the Offspring Cohort (children of the original participants) and the Third Generation Cohort (grandchildren of the original participants).

Data Collection:                                 
Participants undergo regular medical examinations and lifestyle interviews.
Data collected includes physical measurements (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol levels), lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, smoking habits, physical activity), and outcomes (e.g., incidence of heart disease, stroke, diabetes).

Key Findings:                                 
Identification of major cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity.
Development of the Framingham Risk Score, a tool used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual.

## About Dataset
The "Framingham" heart disease dataset includes over 4,240 records,16 columns and 15 attributes. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.
